when ever if we think if there is any of the exception then we need to hold that by using the async




private routing ==>> for the specific role to be accessibale

throw inside of the try catch inside then it will hold by catch of the same section of the section of the middleware
segregratin principle 
to break down all of the code block into the small chunk
also use for the subsituion for the code 
also 



what is cookeies
==>> client side storage 

js cookies


two way of the data sending to the server

readstream create 

what is data?
==> body props

3 diffrent 
1. form data ==> file upload time , primary approach for the file uploading
2. no file ==> row data ,"json" 
3. x-www-form-urlencoded 




streaming and pipeling

stream ==> always will send the data, lushy of the send of the data, data loss or the packet loss 

when we send the data without of the parser then the backend will not know that so, the express will know the data when we send thrrough the body, headers, query, params, 


when to use for the single and none types of the function in the multer
uploader().none()  ==> if the type is multopart / form-data but does not include the file upload

uploader().single()  ==> if the type is myltipart/ form-data but must be only one of the file
let file = req.file
uploader().array()  ===>if the type is multipart/ form-data but need to upload multiple no. of the files
let file = req.files

uploader().fields ([{name:"image", maxCount:1},{name:"Gallery", maxCount:10}]) ===> to upload the fix number of the file 
// this router will find all of the non existing of the routes and this must need to be placed at the end of the other all of the routes\
// app.use((req, res, next)=>{
//         next({
//             code:404,
//             message:"Internal server error....",
//             status:"INTERANAL_SERVER_ERROR"
//         })    
// })


// Garbage collector
    // when ever if ther any of the modules, plugins that are sending the error then we need to hold that error from here as before 


    // this will be seperate then the other middleware

// VVIP 
// thsi will hold from all of the next with an argument then it will hold the error as long from where does it comes from
